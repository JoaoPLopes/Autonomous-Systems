Lidar-Based indoor localization algorithm

In this project we developed a Lidar-Based indoor localization algortihm. The Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) was used as sensor fusion algorithm and Iterative Closest Point (ICP) was used for model matching. The algorithm was tested in the MBOT robot using Robot Operating System (ROS).

This project was developed for the course [Autonomous Systems](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/SAut1077/2019-2020/1-semestre) in IST. The final grade was 19/20
